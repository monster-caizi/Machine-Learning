* SDC.cpp is the C++ implementation of the algorithm in the paper of "Analyzing and Visualizing Web Opinion Development and Social Interactions With Density-Based Clustering". (Yang C C, Ng T D. Analyzing and Visualizing Web Opinion Development and Social Interactions With Density-Based Clustering[J]. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans, 2011, 41(6):1144-1155.)

* The folder of '2016泰迪杯数据挖掘' is the data processing code for a data mining contest.

* The folder of Experiments-of-Caltech-Pedestrian-Dataset is several basic experiments of SVM, K-NN, Decsion Trees and Random Forests with respect to direct experiments on normalized dataset,  direct experiments on sampling training datasets and cross-validation experiments on normalized sampling datasets.

  > Caltech Pedestrian dataset consists of 11 subsets of videos, the first 6 for training and the last 5 for testing. The videos are taken from a vehicle driving in urban areas, and
  > very 30 th frame is used. The data of the course project is obtained from the Caltech
  > pedestrian dataset including a training set (3605 positive samples and 10055
  > negative samples) and a test set (2043 positive samples and 4832 negative
  > samples). A 2330-dimensional Haar-like feature was extracted from each image
  > patch. The purpose of the project is to to develop classifiers, which take
  > input features and predict the labels, compute the precision and recall values
  > of the classifier and find out the best result. In this project, I have carried
  > out both direct experiments and cross-validation experiments to find out best
  > result. Besides, I have experimented K-NN, Decision Trees, Random Forest and
  > SVM to find out the best algorithm with best parameters.
